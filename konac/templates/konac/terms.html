(“BMI”) develops and maintains websites and other Internet and mobile-based services (“BMI Sites and Services” or “BMI Site or Service”) for access and use by the general public and the industries that BMI serves including BMI’s affiliated songwriters, composers and music publishers, licensing customers and the music industry in general.  These Terms and Conditions of Use are generally applicable across all of BMI’s Sites and Services.  However, individual BMI Sites and Services may have additional and/or modified terms and conditions of use that are specific to that BMI Site or Service.  If there is a conflict between any provision under these Terms and Condition of Use and any additional or modified provision that is specific to a BMI Site or Service, the additional or modified provision governs. These Terms and Conditions of Use, together with any additional and/or modified terms and conditions of use for any specific BMI Site or Service, are referred to as the “Applicable Terms of Use.”

            BMI Sites and Services, and the contents made available on the BMI Sites and Services, are protected under U.S. copyright law and other international, federal and state laws that protect intellectual property.

            By accessing and/or using any of BMI’s Sites and Services, you agree that you are bound by the Applicable Terms of Use.  Any unauthorized use of BMI Sites and Services, including but not limited to, entry into BMI’s systems, misuse of passwords, misuse of any information posted on or to the BMI Sites and Services, or otherwise engaging in any activity relating to the BMI Sites and Services that is contrary to applicable law or regulations, or the terms of any agreement that you may have with BMI including, but not limited to, the Applicable Terms of Use, is strictly prohibited.

            BMI reserves the right to change the Applicable Terms of Use at any time by publishing the modified version on the BMI Site or Service.  By using the BMI Sites or Service after any published changes, you agree to be bound by the modified Applicable Terms of Use.
